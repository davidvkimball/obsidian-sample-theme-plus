## First Time Publishing a Theme?

2. Clone your new repository to your computer
3. Inside `manifest.json`, change the "name" field to your theme name
4. Add your name to the "author" field in `manifest.json`
5. Edit `theme.css` to add your styles

## How to Use

### Basic Development

- Clone this repo
- Edit `theme.css` to customize your theme's appearance
- Test your theme by copying `theme.css` and `manifest.json` to your vault's `.obsidian/themes/your-theme-name/` folder
- Reload Obsidian to see your changes

### Using the AI System

- Read `AGENTS.md` for project-specific instructions
- Check `.agents/` folder for development guides
- See `.agents/quick-reference.md` for a one-page cheat sheet

### Using Reference Materials

- Access Obsidian API: `.ref/obsidian-api/obsidian.d.ts`
- View sample theme code: `.ref/obsidian-sample-theme/`
- View sample plugin code: `.ref/obsidian-sample-plugin/`

## Adding your theme to the Theme Gallery

1. Include a screenshot thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio, recommended size 512x288)
2. Submit a Pull Request to [`obsidianmd/obsidian-releases`](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases#community-theme)

## Releasing Versions

1. From your theme's repository, click on "Releases"
2. Click **Draft a new Release**
3. Fill out the Release information:
   - **Choose a Tag**: Create a new tag with your version number
   - **Release Title**: The version number
   - **Description**: What changed (optional)
   - **Files**: Upload `manifest.json` and `theme.css`
4. Click "Publish Release"
5. Update `versions.json` if needed (maps theme version → minimum Obsidian version)

> **Tip:** You can simplify the version bump process by running `npm version patch`, `npm version minor` or `npm version major` after updating `minAppVersion` manually in `manifest.json`.

## GitHub Actions Workflows (Optional)

This template includes GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

- **`lint.yml`** - Automatically checks your CSS on every push (validates with Stylelint)
- **`release.yml`** - Automatically creates GitHub releases when you push a version tag

**These workflows are completely optional** - your theme works fine without them. They're included as a convenience for automated testing and releases.

**If you want to modify the workflows:**
- You can edit them directly on GitHub.com (no special permissions needed)
- If you want to push workflow changes via Git, you'll need a Personal Access Token with the `workflow` scope (see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens))
- Most users won't need to modify workflows - they work out of the box

## Troubleshooting

### Reference folder not working

If `.ref` folder is empty or symlinks are broken:
1. Re-run the appropriate setup script (`.bat` for Windows, `.sh` for macOS/Linux)
2. Check that the central location exists: `../.ref/obsidian-dev/`

**Windows symlink issues:**
- Run PowerShell/CMD as Administrator, or
- Enable Developer Mode: Settings → Privacy & Security → For developers → Developer Mode

### Theme not appearing in Obsidian

1. Make sure `manifest.json` and `theme.css` are in `.obsidian/themes/your-theme-name/`
2. Verify `manifest.json` has the correct `name` field
3. Reload Obsidian (Settings → Appearance → Themes)
4. Check that `theme.css` contains valid CSS

## Manually Installing the Theme

- Copy over `theme.css` and `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/themes/your-theme-name/`
- Reload Obsidian and enable the theme in Settings → Appearance → Themes

## Funding URL

You can include funding URLs in your `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
    "fundingUrl": "https://buymeacoffee.com"
}
```

Or for multiple URLs:

```json
{
    "fundingUrl": {
        "Buy Me a Coffee": "https://buymeacoffee.com",
        "GitHub Sponsor": "https://github.com/sponsors"
    }
}
```
